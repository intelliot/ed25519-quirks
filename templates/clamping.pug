  p.lead.mb-4 Why is the scalar component of the secret key in Ed25519 clamped as specified?

  p ’Cause security, obviously.

  p.
    For realsies, tho: clamping breaks the linear relation between secret and public keys, so stuff like
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">hierarchical key derivation</a>
    or plain outsourced vanity address grinding becomes difficult compared to cryptosystems
    with such a relationship (e.g., the secp256k1 elliptic curve with either ECDSA or Schnorr).
    In some cases, the damage is irreparable: as clamping leaves space for just <code>2<sup>251</sup></code>
    secret scalars as opposed to <code>ℓ = 2<sup>252</sup> + …</code> possibilities, arithmetic on public keys
    that would map to secret keys is impossible. It is relatively easy to get rid of restrictions by not clamping
    secret scalars, but there must be <em>some</em> reasons they’re clamped, right?

  p.
    For real realsies, setting one of higher bits to one <em>sort of</em> makes sense;
    <a href="https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000860.html">it enables to not allow
    for the zero scalar</a> during signature generation.
    Setting lower 3 bits to zero
    <a href="https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000861.html">might protect</a>
    against extracting the secret key by solving
    a fitting <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~sdg/igor-slides.pdf">hidden number problem</a>
    (which were shown to be an effective attack vector for other cryptosystems, e.g., ECDSA).

  p.small.
    Alternatively, setting lower bits supposedly protects against
    <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/55632/libsodium-x25519-and-ed25519-small-order-check/55643#55643">small-subgroup
    attacks</a>, but relevance of these attacks to signing is a conundrum on its own
    (originally, small-subgroup attacks apply to key exchange).
